# Forgery-GAN
A DL model to modify forged images to make it more difficult to be detected by forgery detection algorithms.

Apologies for this project is not currently at a working stage <Figured Post Quantum Crypto. should be fun, will come back to this project in near future>

The basic structure is built and one can easily read through and run the notebook to get an idea of the project. I still need to tweak the hyperparameters to get proper results. And actually, run the notebook for more than one epoch without the collab GPU crashing on me.
